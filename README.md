# Prší card game

## Game rules
Old school European card game, where players start with hand of 5 cards and have to end up with empty hands.  
Additionally, here, added a rule to keep the game progressing based on the outcome of each round.

- your opponent is computer here
- no animations
- winner of the round plays with one card less and loser gets one more, on the start of next round
